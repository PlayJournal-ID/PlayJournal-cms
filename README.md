PlayJournal-cms
===============

A simple content management system that (will) support a full magazine workflow, from writing to editing to posting. PlayJournal is build using Play! Framework 2.0 on Scala.

PlayJournal is currently in heavy development, with lots of features missing and no real easy deploying wizards. It is not production ready yet.

To run PlayJournal you will first need:

1. A database named 'playjournal_cms' on MySQL (only MySQL is supported as of now)
2. Play! Framework 2.0 and Scala installed

After you have all the prerequisites, just run the following command:

    play ~run
    
and it should run with no problem.

Thank you very much.
